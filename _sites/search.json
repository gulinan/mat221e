The medical report should be handed in immediately (within two days of its expiration).\nClass Attendance Policy:\nThe students must attend at least 70% of classes and are deemed responsible to manage his/her absences.\nParticipation Policy:\nThe students are expected to ask and answer questions, participate in in-class activities, and show their interest and engagement in the class.\nE-mail Policy:\nPlease:\nUse a proper descriptive subject line (which may consist of the course number MAT221E followed by a short phrase summarizing the subject of your e-mail).\nStart off your e-mail with a proper greeting, introduce yourself (give your name), then state your problem as short as possible.\nFinally, use a proper closing and then finish your e-mail with your first name and so on.\nFeel free to send me e-mails. But be sure you that give me enough time to get back to you. In the past, I have had pretty much tolerance for e-mail messages sent after business hours and at weekends. But, now, due to pandemic, I should say that I may not appreciate these e-mails anymore. Lastly, e-mails asking for grade grubbing at the end of the semester are not welcomed.\nAcademic Honesty Policy:\nAt every stage of the academic life, every ITU student is responsible for obeying the academic honesty policy of ITU stated below:\nhttps://odek.itu.edu.tr/en/code-of-honor/ethics-in-university-life.\nEquity, Diversity, and Inclusion:\nIn this class, I am committed to cultural and individual differences and diversity as including, but not limited to, age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, language, national origin, race, religion, culture, and socioeconomic status and I acknowledge the value of differences.\nStudent with Special Needs:\nIf you are a student with special needs, let me know that how we can adjust the course environment and materials in accordance with your needs. Furthermore, you are also invited to contact the office of students with special needs at:\nhttp://engelsiz.itu.edu.tr/.\nITU Distance Education Policy:\nSharing the lecture recordings or its piece with third parties is strictly forbidden. Furthermore, the recordings are subject to investigation by the authorities as needed. For that reason, be sure that you behave (both orally and verbally) responsibly in this virtual class.
