**Course Objectives:** This course aims to: 

1.	To provide the basic concepts of probability.
2.	To set up probability models for a range of random phenomena, both discrete and continuous.
3.	To develop critical thinking skills and abilities to apply calculus techniques (i.e., limits,

- **Midterm date**: December 9, 2021 during the lecture hour in class. 
- **Student studies, namely, quizzes and exam papers which are not written well, does not follow a proper mathematical writing language, and are hard to review, will get "0" credit for that question.**
- Please see an example for **a good homework** on Ninova.
- Please read the general advice given at:

  http://ma117.math.metu.edu.tr/course-info/general-advice/.

**Late Submission Policy:** There are **NO** make-ups for missed quizzes.

**Final Exam Attendance Policy:** At least 20% of in-semester studies.

**Make-Up Exam Policy:** The students who miss either midterm exam or final exam due to a health problem
can take a make-up exam as long as they have a valid medical report taken on the exam day. The medical report should be handed in immediately (within two days of its expiration). 


**Class Attendance Policy:** 

The students must attend at least 70% of classes and
are deemed responsible to manage his/her absences.

**Participation Policy:** 

The students are expected to ask and answer
questions, participate in in-class activities, and
show their interest and engagement in the class. 


**E-mail Policy:**

Please:

1. Use a proper descriptive subject line (which may consist of the course number MAT221E followed
by a short phrase summarizing the subject of your e-mail).
2. Start off your e-mail with a proper greeting, introduce yourself (give your name), then state your problem as short as possible.
3. Finally, use a proper closing and then finish your e-mail with your first name and so on.

Feel free to send me e-mails. But be sure you that give me enough time to get back to you. In the past, I have had pretty much tolerance for e-mail messages sent after business hours and at weekends. But, now, due to pandemic, I should say that I may not appreciate these e-mails anymore.
Lastly, e-mails asking for grade grubbing at the end of the semester are not welcomed.


**Academic Honesty Policy:** 

At every stage of the academic life, every ITU student is responsible for obeying the academic honesty policy of ITU stated below:

https://odek.itu.edu.tr/en/code-of-honor/ethics-in-university-life.
   

**Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion:** 

In this class, I am committed to cultural and individual differences and diversity as including, but not limited to, age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, language, national origin, race, religion, culture, and socioeconomic status and I acknowledge the value of differences. 

  
**Student with Special Needs:** 

If you are a student with special needs, let me know
that how we can adjust the course environment and materials in accordance with your needs. 
Furthermore, you are also invited to contact the office of students with special needs at:

http://engelsiz.itu.edu.tr/.

**ITU Distance Education Policy:** 

Sharing the lecture recordings or its piece with third parties is strictly forbidden. Furthermore, the recordings are subject to investigation by the authorities as needed. For that reason, be sure that you behave (both orally and verbally) responsibly in this virtual class. Please visit:
