  announced at well in advance. No make-up for quizzes.
\item
  \textbf{Student studies, namely, quizzes and exam papers which are not
  written well, does not follow a proper mathematical writing language,
  and are hard to review, will get ``0'' credit for that question.}
\item
  Please see an example for \textbf{a good homework} on Ninova.
\item
  Please read the general advice given at:

  \url{http://ma117.math.metu.edu.tr/course-info/general-advice/}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Late Submission Policy:} There are \textbf{NO} make-ups for
missed quizzes.

\textbf{Final Exam Attendance Policy:} At least 30 points from
in-semester studies (e.g., (Midterm * 0.4 + Quiz 1 * 0.1 + Quiz 2 * 0.1)
greater than or equal to 30)

\textbf{Make-Up Exam Policy:} The students who miss either midterm exam
or final exam due to a health problem can take a make-up exam as long as
they have a valid medical report taken on the exam day. The medical
report should be handed in immediately (within two days of its
expiration).

\textbf{Class Attendance Policy:}

The students are encouraged to attend classes, whereas the attendance is
not mandatory in Fall 2021 semester due to Covid-19 pandemic. For that
reason, the student is deemed responsible to manage his/her absences.

\textbf{Participation Policy:}

The students are expected to ask and answer questions, participate in
in-class activities, and show their interest and engagement in the
class.

\textbf{E-mail Policy:}

Please:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Use a proper descriptive subject line (which may consist of the course
  number MAT221E followed by a short phrase summarizing the subject of
  your e-mail).
\item
  Start off your e-mail with a proper greeting, introduce yourself (give
  your name), then state your problem as short as possible.
\item
  Finally, use a proper closing and then finish your e-mail with your
  first name and so on.
\end{enumerate}

Feel free to send me e-mails. But be sure you that give me enough time
to get back to you. In the past, I have had pretty much tolerance for
e-mail messages sent after business hours and at weekends. But, now, due
to pandemic, I should say that I may not appreciate these e-mails
anymore. Lastly, e-mails asking for grade grubbing at the end of the
semester are not welcomed.

\textbf{Academic Honesty Policy:}

At every stage of the academic life, every ITU student is responsible
for obeying the academic honesty policy of ITU stated below:

\url{https://odek.itu.edu.tr/en/code-of-honor/ethics-in-university-life}.

\textbf{Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion:}

In this class, I am committed to cultural and individual differences and
diversity as including, but not limited to, age, disability, ethnicity,
gender, gender identity, language, national origin, race, religion,
culture, and socioeconomic status and I acknowledge the value of
differences.

\textbf{Student with Special Needs:}

If you are a student with special needs, let me know that how we can
adjust the course environment and materials in accordance with your
needs. Furthermore, you are also invited to contact the office of
students with special needs at:

\url{http://engelsiz.itu.edu.tr/}.
